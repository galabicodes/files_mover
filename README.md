# File Mover System

## Purpose

Moves files from a source folder to a destination folder automatically based on their type or name. Helps organize files cleanly without manual work.

## Why It's Powerful

- Automates file organization
- Safe and efficient with clear paths
- Easy to customize conditions (e.g., move only `.pdf` or files starting with certain letters)
- Works in seconds and saves hours

## Example Use

- Move `.pdf` files from your Desktop to a documents folder
- Sort downloaded images into image folders
- Organize work projects by file name patterns

## Notes

This system is best used with other systems like Folder Creator, which ensures the destination folder exists.
